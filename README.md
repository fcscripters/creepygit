# Git Hub Followers Visualisation 'Creepy Git'

A visualisation of followers/followed on Github.A user will be able to authenticate their session and see a visual display of if they are follwoing somone and that user is not following them back and vice a versa. The final hurrah of the mighty fcscripters.
